>Inspiration from the Mapbox Gallery [Frank](https://studio.mapbox.com/styles/mitchelljh/ckgrzk5sz0x3619qglldgylrt/edit/#15.19/38.891725/-77.037855) Style & the Vintage Color Palettes from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending/vintage).

### <i>How was the base map style determined?</i>

This Vintage-Themed Base Map was inspired by my interests and viewing the Frank Mapbox Style in the Styles Gallery. Additionally, exploring the color palettes on Coolors gave ideas to create a vintage colored base map using similar colors in my base map. I realized to make an effective base map, I needed to use colors slightly varying from the palette so that the elements could be more cohesive in the base map design. The font labels were changed to fit in a more simplistic design; with the vintage-style base map, I wanted to embody a minimalistic base map highlighting natural features as the subject.
### <i>What is this base map designed to showcase?</i>
As with many base maps, this base map can be used for a variety of symbologies and subjects. The theme of this base map makes it useful for highlighting specific places of interest. With the terrain differences and the simplistic color scheme, this base map can be used for thematic mapping. I would create a National Parks on International Parks map showcasing park areas and the number of visitors. To embody the vintage theme, I would use this base map to create a Travel Wish List map; the vintage, minimalist theme makes it a map where features, places, or travel modes (showing roadways, flight routes) can be highlighted effectively.
